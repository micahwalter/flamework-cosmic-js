# flamework-cosmic-js

This is a drop in library for managing content in a [Flamework](http://github.com/exflickr/flamework) application with [Cosmic JS](https://cosmicjs.com/).

There is a `www/include/lib_cosmic.php` which makes simple `GET` requests to the Cosmic JS API endpoint.

In the `www/page.php` file there is an example of how to use this to grab content from your objects managed in Cosmic JS.
